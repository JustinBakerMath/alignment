A principled approach to data analysis includes data alignment, canonical form and constructing all automorphims.
As such, each directory contains the following structure.

```bash
 complete - a complete invariant applied to the data
 canon - a canonical form of the data
 dfa - a deterministic finite automaton
 automorph - all data automorphisms of the group
 alignment - disentangle the group action from the data
